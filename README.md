# Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson (2001) Replication

Replication files for Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson's (2001) paper, "The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation. The American Economic Review," 91(5), 1369–1401. 

Overview: This is a quick repreduction of the main IV results I conducted for one of my advanced linear models classes in graduate school. Scheve and Stasavage’s (2010) paper, The Conscription of Wealth: Mass Warfare and the Demand for Progressive Taxation, argued that “mobilization for mass warfare led to demands for increased taxation of the wealthy to more fairly distribute the burden for the war effort” (Scheve & Stasavage, 2010). I replicate the main findings of Scheve and Stasavage (2010), being, Table (1) and Table (3). I find that the arguments of Scheve and Stasavage (2010) hold up well under reproduction, with the authors correctly estimating the influences of war mobilization on taxation and their findings robust to alternative specifications. There are a large number of null values in their data, which should be taken into consideration when interpreting results.
